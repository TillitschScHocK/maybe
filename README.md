## Hosting

This forked version of Maybe is a fully functional finance app that can be
easily [self-hosted via Docker](docs/hosting/docker.md).

### üöÄ Quickstart with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project folder with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: maybe
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: maybe
      POSTGRES_DB: maybe_production
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  web:
    build: .
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://maybe:maybe@db:5432/maybe_production
      RAILS_ENV: production
    command: bash -c "bin/setup && bin/dev"

volumes:
  db_data:
```

Then start the application with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

üëâ The app will then be available at:
[**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) or [**http://SERVER-IP:3000**](http://SERVER-IP:3000)
